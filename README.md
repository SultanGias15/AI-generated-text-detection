# AI-generated-text-detection 

The objective of this project was to identify AI-generated text vs. human written text. The problem statement is as follows: Can you predict the 'ind' (0= human, 1 = AI) as a function of the 768 document embeddings, the word count and the punctuation?

All text data was converted into embeddings and the project further details the outcomes of this endeavor. Below are some comments that arose during this project.
